    <h1>üçî Regular Hamburger üçî</h1>

    I have actually made this recipe before, it went well! Recommend it! </i>üòÄ</p>

    <p>The McDonald's regular hamburger is the one that got it all started in 1948. It's as basic as can be... yet the
    ones they serve today don't even taste CLOSE! Make them exactly as I instruct, and you can enjoy that long-
    lost flavor once again.</p>
    <p>(In the mid 80's, McDonald's began cooking both sides of the meat at the same time. This was to cut cooking
    time in half. But it also forever changed the flavor of the original hamburgers - ALL of them!)</p>
    <p>Ray Kroc discovered the McDonald brother's San Bernardino, California restaurant in 1954 while selling multi-
    mixers. (milk-shake machines) He was so impressed with their methods, he struck up a franchise deal, and in
    1955 opened his first store in De Plaines Illinois. Oh, and he went on to earn multi-millions.</p>
    <p>"Ten Regs please"... "Ten Regs, thank you"</p>
    (An old production call for ten burgers)</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <li>
        <ul>1 Pound ground chuck (80% lean)</ul>
        <ul>10 Small hamburger buns</ul>
        <ul>10 Hamburger dill slices</ul>
        <ul>10 teaspoons dried, chopped onion</ul>
        <ul>McDonald's Hamburger Seasoning</ul>
        <ul>Mustard, Ketchup... and... waxed paper</ul>
        <ul>The Hamburger Seasoning</ul>
        <ul>4 tablespoons salt</ul>
        <ul>2 tablespoons Accent?(MSG)</ul>
        <ul>1 teaspoon ground black pepper</ul>
        <ul>1/4 teaspoon onion powder</ul>
    </li>
    <p>Mix all ingredients well in a spice shaker with big enough holes to allow pepper to flow. Makes about 3
    ounces. Use on ALL McDonald's hamburgers. (unless you're allergic to MSG, then just use salt and pepper)</p>
    <p><strong>The Beef Patties</strong></p>
    <p>Divide 1 lb of beef into 10 equal sized balls. Form a patty out of each ball about 4 inches in diameter and 1/4
    inch thick. Do this on waxed paper.</p>
    <p>Now freeze the patties for at least an hour. (this keeps them from falling apart when you grill them)
    Obviously you'll do this in advance of "burger time". It is pretty tough to make patties this small, so if you come
    up with 9 patties, I'll forgive you.</p>
    <p><strong>The Onions</strong></p>
    <p>Put the dried onions in a container, oh.. like Tupperware... and add water. Water should be a few inches over
    the top of the onions. (better to have too much water than not enough) Cover, and refrigerate about 1/2 hour.
    Drain the liquid, and BAM... you have McDonald's little baby onions.</p>
    <p>Cover again and refrigerate until 'burger time'.</p>
    <p><strong>The Pickles</strong></p>
    <p>McDonald's pickle slices are unique in flavor, very sour dills. The only product I know of that comes close to
    the distinctive flavor is HEINZ Genuine Dills. (original sour dill) But they don't come in slices, so slice your own
    VERY thin. I can't do it very well with a knife, so I use a K-Tel "dial-a-slice" home vegetable slicer. ALSO...
    Vlasic "original" dills have that tart flavor. Make sure they're not "kosher" dills. Wal-Mart?carries Vlasic
    ORIGINAL dills, and you have to slice those too. (note, these pickles are pretty small, so slice at an angle...
    you'll get bigger dill chips) USE THESE PICKLES ON ALL McDonald's HAMBURGERS!</p>
    <p><strong>The Buns</strong></p>
    <p>Use the small, plain cheapo store brand hamburger buns. You know, they come 8 or 12 in a pack. - usually
    about 59 to 69 cents for a pack of 8.</p>
    <p>(You'll want to separate the tops, or "crowns" from the bottoms, or "heels"... as most likely they'll be
    connected slightly on one edge) When it's "burger time", you'll be toasting the buns. Those instructions coming up. \
    WalMart sells a great product for regular buns - Great ValueTM brand "jumbo" hamburger buns.
    They're almost exactly like McDonald's buns and a little bigger than the other hamburger buns available at
    your supermarket</p>

    <h2>Cooking Your Hamburgers</h2>
    <p>Pre-heat your oven to warm - its lowest level, this is for later. You're going to need two electric griddles - one
    to grill the meat, the other to toast the buns. Pre-heat the meat griddle to 375-400? and the bun griddle to
    about 350? (this recipe has you cooking four at a time)</p>
    <p>Note: before starting, make sure to have all of your condiments READY (because this all happens very fast)</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Toast the crowns of 4 buns (tops) Do this by laying them face down on the griddle closely together. Put a
        Dutch oven (pot) bottom side down directly on top of the buns. (open side facing up) This is only to apply
        hands-free pressure to the buns so they will toast evenly. (Don't use anything TOO heavy like cast iron. You'll
        smash the buns)</li>
        <li>Lay the frozen patties on the other grill. After about 20 seconds, "sear" them by applying even pressure
        with the back of a metal spatula, and pushing down on the front with your free hand. (careful not to burn your
        fingers) Do this only for about 2 seconds... you should hear them sizzle louder while you "sear" them. After
        searing them, sprinkle generously with McDonald's burger seasoning.</li>
        <li>At this point, your buns are nearly done. They will have an even tan color when finished. Remove them,
        and repeat the "bun toasting" process with the heels. (bottoms)</li>
        <li>After about one minute since searing the patties, turn them over. Careful, don't tear the side you seared.
        Add another dash of Seasoning and about a teaspoon of your prepared onions. (Don't be anal and use a
        measuring spoon... no time... just two fingers and a thumb full)</li>
        <li>Now quickly dress your buns. (crown, or top side) Mustard first... five "kisses" the diameter of a pencil
        evenly spaced in a circle about a half-inch from the edge.
        Then the Ketchup, (use Hunt's if you can) five squirts the size of a nickel.. in the pattern found on dice. Place
        the pickle in the middle.</li>
        <li>By the time you finish that, the meat will be done. (about 1 minute or 1:10 after turning) Remove the meat
        and tilt to the side to allow excess fat to drain off. Use your free hand to hold down the onions. Place patties
        onion side up on the dressed crown, top with toasted heels. (the burger will be upside-down)</li>
        <li>Lay one finished hamburger, still upside-down, in the center of your pre-cut waxed paper. Wrap the paper
        around the burger tightly. It should resemble a very oblong tube with two open ends, and the burger in the
        middle. Then wrap the open ends underneath the bottom of the burger so it is enclosed tightly.</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>"Q-ing" Methods</h2>
    <p>"Q-ing" was a McDonald's term for helping the flavors to meld via mechanical means; i.e. heat lamp or
    microwave.</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Place wrapped hamburger in your pre-heated oven. (remember... oven is just barely on warm) Keep them
        in there about 8-10 minutes. Hey! That's enough time to cook another batch. (if you do cook another batch
        while these are "aging properly", scrape the black stuff and burnt onions to the side before beginning)
        <p><strong>Important note:</strong></p>
        <p>Some ovens get too hot even on low, and this may dry out your burger. If they seem dry try
        the alternative "Q-ing" method below.</p></li>
        <li>An alternate "Q-ing" method would be to wrap the sandwich tightly in wax paper, let sit for 5 minutes, and
        microwave on high for 15 seconds (while still wrapped) This will complete the "Q-ing" process without over
        microwaving them like they do now. In fact, they almost taste better this way. In fact, you can use this method
        on ALL of the burger recipes on this site, with the exception of the McD.L.T.</li>
    </ol>
    ENJOY! This is how they used to be. This is how they were MEANT to be.
    (You might consider toasting your buns first, at least the crowns, to give you extra time to dress them)
